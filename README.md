# Movie-Recommender-Systems
The Movie Recommender Systems Project uses the MovieLens dataset to develop a system that suggests movies based on user preferences and past behavior. With data on 45,000 movies and 26 million ratings, the project employs collaborative filtering techniques, like SVD, to predict user ratings and recommend personalized movies. Additionally, a simple recommender suggests popular movies based on ratings and genres. The project includes data preprocessing, analysis, and deployment through Flask, showcasing the practical application of machine learning in enhancing user experiences.
